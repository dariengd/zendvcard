We needed a parser and generator for Vcards written in PHP for the Zend Framework.

We are building this by the standards described in this document: http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcard-21.doc

I would love if more people contributed to the project so that soon we can have it in the official Zend Framework ;)

Development was started for the product suplify (http://suplify.me) by the komola UG
